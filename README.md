# Used Cars Price Prediction
This project aims to scrap the website [Autoscout24](https://www.autoscout24.com/lst?atype=C&desc=0&sort=standard&source=homepage_search-mask&ustate=N%2CU) and acquire information about the used cars such as:
- mark
- model
- mileage
- transmission
- registration
- fuel
- power
- location
- price  

This data will be used to train ML models and predict price changing for a desired car.
